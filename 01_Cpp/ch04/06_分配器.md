分配器的实现比较简单，只要实现了标准定义的以下方法就可以了:
- `构造函数`: Construct allocator object (public member function)
- `析构函数`: Allocator destructor (public member function)
- `address`: Return address (public member function)
- `allocate`: Allocate block of storage (public member function)
- `deallocate`: Release block of storage (public member function)
- `max_size`: Maximum size possible to allocate (public member function)
- `construct`: Construct an object (public member function)
- `destroy`: Destroy an object (public member function)

很少会自己会实现一个分配器，除非是极少特殊情况。
