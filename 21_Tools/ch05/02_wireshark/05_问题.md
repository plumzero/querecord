### unmet dependencies

在对 wireshark 各版本的尝试安装过程中，出现了一个问题。在尝试安装高版本失败后，又重新装回低版本，启动 wireshark 时出现如下信息:
```s

笔者想卸载 wireshark:
```s
    sudo apt-get --purge remove wireshark
```
无法执行成功，且出现如下报错:
```s

You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:

```
通过 `which wireshark` 仍可以找到 wireshark 。

可以通过如下命令进行修复:
```s
    sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

Bingo!
